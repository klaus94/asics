Püschel et al.: Towards Systematic Model-based Testing of Self-adaptive Software

    - grundlagen self-adaptive systems:
    reconfigure automatically, runs in a control loop with four tasks: monitoring, analysis, planning, execution
    
    -the need of software tests in SAS: certification, delivered and left to customer -> reliable, evaluated, fault-prevention
    a lot components (in the control loop) -> lots of information -> hard to manage for a test engineer with manual tests

    - MBT:
    FMEA - failure mode and effects analysis
    black box approach
    required information that must be gathered (testing in general): scenarios, how failure can occur and can be found; properties that can be influenced by failures; potential error propagation
    more specific for MBT: failure analysis, requirements identificcation
    failure analysis:
        - idetnification of failure dimensions and properties (Failure Domain Model)
        - failue senarios
        - visualization of error propagation (Fault Dependency Graph)
    analysation of MAPE-K process (Monitor, Analyze, Playn, Execute - Knowledge)
    SAS components provides service: specification -> expected behaviour
        - failure defined as deviation from this behaviour
        - error is the part of the system that leads to the failure
        - fault: cause of an error
    error: dimensions type and localization
        - types: inconsistency in (1) knowledge representation, (2) model itself, (3) incorrect intermediate state
        - localization: locally or globally in potentially distributed SAS
    failures: 
        - qualitative vs. functional
        - internally vs. externally (sensor/effector)
        - un-intentional, missed or semantically wrong adaptation attempts
    criticality of adaptations: harmless, mission-critical, safety-critical
    failure senarios: page 5 of 6
        - misinterpreted sensor data from the monitor
        - wrong implemented adaptation rule condition leads to wrong or unintentionally adaptaion initiation
        - wrong recording of events

Püschel et al. a black box validation strategy for self-adaptive systems

    task of self-adaptive systems:
    - fulfilling tasks more efficiently, may find solutions to tasks that were not explicity defined

    limitation of testing SAS:
    - SAS can get into situations that were not thought of in the contruction and modelling of this system
    -> validation to gain trust

    MBT
    - executing comprehensive test cases is expensive and very difficult -> generating test cases with models is the solution
    - creating a metamodel compactly specifying all behavioral and adaptation-related aspects
    - models could be some state-flow charts 
    - from different state-flow charts there can be generated lots of test cases
