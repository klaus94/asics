  abstract = {Future software systems will operate in a highly dynamic world. Systems will need to operate correctly despite of unespected changes in factors such as environmental conditions, user requirements, technology, legal regulations, and market opportunities. They will have to operate in a constantly evolving environment that includes people, content, electronic devices, and legacy systems. They will thus need the ability to continuously adapt themselves in an automated manner to react to those changes. To realize dynamic, self-adaptive systems, the service concept has emerged as a suitable abstraction mechanism. Together with the concept of the service-oriented architecture (SOA), this led to the development of technologies, standards, and methods to build service-based applications by flexibly aggregating individual services. This article discusses how those concepts came to be by taking two complementary viewpoints. On the one hand, it evaluates the progress in software technologies and methodologies that led to the service concept and SOA. On the other hand, it discusses how the evolution of the requirements, and in particular business goals, influenced the progress towards highly dynamic self-adaptive systems. Finally, based on a discussion of the current state of the art, this article points out the possible future evolution of the field.},

  abstract    = {Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with change during operation. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. However, current solutions can only handle pre-specified requirements either in the form of setpoint values (S-reqs) or values to be optimized (O-reqs). This paper presents SimCA* that makes two contributions to control-based self-adaptation: (a) it allows the user to specify a third type of requirement that keeps a value above/below a threshold (T-reqs); and (b) it can deal with requirement sets that change at runtime (i.e., requirements can be adjusted, activated, and deactivated on the fly). SimCA* offers robustness to disturbances and provides adaptation guarantees. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict goals from different domains: an underwater vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance, and a tele-assistance system for health care support. The test results demonstrate that SimCA* can deal with the three types of requirements (STO-reqs) operating under various types of dynamics and the set of requirements can be changed on the fly. },

  abstract = {A system built in terms of autonomous software agents may require even greater correctness assurance than one that is merely reacting to the immediate control of its users. Agents make substantial decisions for themselves, so thorough testing is an important consideration. However, autonomy also makes testing harder; by their nature, autonomous agents may react in different ways to the same inputs over time, because, for instance they have changeable goals and knowledge. For this reason, we argue that testing of autonomous agents requires a procedure that caters for a wide range of test case contexts, and that can search for the most demanding of these test cases, even when they are not apparent to the agents' developers. In this paper, we address this problem, introducing and evaluating an approach to testing autonomous agents that uses evolutionary optimisation to generate demanding test cases. We propose a methodology to derive objective (fitness) functions that drive evolutionary algorithms, and evaluate the overall approach with two simulated autonomous agents. The obtained results show that our approach is effective in finding good test cases automatically.},

  abstract  = {It is challenging to design, develop, and validate a dynamically adaptive system (DAS) that satisfies requirements, particularly when requirements can change at run time. Testing at design time can help verify and validate that a DAS satisfies its specified requirements and constraints. While offline tests may demonstrate that a DAS is capable of satisfying its requirements before deployment, a DAS may encounter unanticipated system and environmental conditions that can prevent it from achieving its objectives. In working towards a requirements-aware DAS, this paper proposes run-time monitoring and adaptation of tests as another technique for evaluating whether a DAS satisfies, or is even capable of satisfying, its requirements given its current execution context. To this end, this paper motivates the need and identifies challenges for adaptively testing a DAS at run time, as well as suggests possible methods for leveraging offline testing techniques for verifying run-time behavior. © 2013 IEEE.},
