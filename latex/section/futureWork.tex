\section{Future Work}
- our research has shown: \\
	- modelbased testing good for ensure good behavior prior to deployment (needed for safety-critcal systems - certification process)\\
	- self-testing good for dealing with adaptive character of SAS\\
-> maybe a combination of both methods can lead to better testing-methods

- how both methods could benefit from each other:\\
- modelbased testing -> creating a model of the system -> use this model including constraints as input for a testmanager, that can check during runtime\\
- self-testing methods -> monitoring system during runtime and collecting data -> keeping the data can improve offline-testing with model-based tests (cheap test-data)
