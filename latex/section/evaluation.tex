\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Criteria}
For our evaluation of the different testing strategies, we need some criteria. With the help of these criteria we can rate and compare the strategies. \\
Below is the list of our criteria with explanations:
\begin{itemize}
\item control during runtime... amount of impact of the test-suite during execution
\item ensure quality before deploy... how much quality can the test-suite encure before the system gets deployed
\item performance overhead... amount of additional effort for running the test-suite simultanously to the system, which includes time and memory
\item testing-cost... how complex is building the test for the developer
\item adaptability... how easy can the test-suite be adapted to an other system
\end{itemize}

information for evaluation:\\

selftesting: \\
+ keeping the monitored data can be a good source for later offline-tests\\
- overhead at runtime\\
\\
test-manager\\
+ flexible, relatively independent component\\
- overhead at runtime (safe adaption with validation has higher time overhead, lower memory overhead; replication with validation has lower time overhead, but higher memory overhead)\\
- cannot guarantee good behavior prior to deployment -> need to be combined with traditional tests\\
- there might be situations, where the testmanager can not handle a validation of a constraint (e.g. response time)\\
\\
corridor enforcing infrastructure:\\
+ An advantage of this method is, that testing the corridor enforcing infrastructure would be enough to guarantee good system behavior. The system itself does not need to be tested.\\
+ testing the CEI is easier than testing the system itself\\
- big infrastructure\\
