\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Criteria}
what are our evaluation critera?\\
- control during runtime\\
- ensure quality before deploy\\
- performance overhead (time, memory)\\
- testing-cost (how complex is building the test)\\
- adaptability (how easy can the test-suite be adapted)\\
- maybe something like: Generalization (how general is the approach)\\

\subsection{Comparison}

information for evaluation:

selftesting: 
- keeping the monitored data can be a good source for later offline-tests

corridor enforcing infrastructure:
- An advantage of this method is, that testing the corridor enforcing infrastructure would be enough to guarantee good system behavior. The system itself does not need to be tested.
