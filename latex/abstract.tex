\section{Abstract}

During the past years, the requirements for software-systems have changed dramatically. Software now often needs to be self-adaptive. This also leads to a different process of development. One important aspect of developing software is testing. Due to the unflexibility of traditional tests, there is a need for new testing-methods. There are some approches, that target this problem. What is missing is an overview about them. \\
Therefor we want to categorize, shortly describe and evaluate the different ideas, that exist in current literature.\\
